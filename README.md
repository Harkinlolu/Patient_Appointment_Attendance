A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO REDUCING MISSED APPOINTMENTS AND IMPROVING HEALTHCARE EFFICIENCY
Overview
This project aims to tackle the critical issue of missed medical appointments (no-shows) in healthcare systems. By applying a robust end-to-end data science pipeline, the objective is to predict patient attendance based on historical appointment data. This prediction enables better resource allocation, improved patient engagement, and optimised clinical workflows.
Objectives
Key objectives include:
•	Clean and preprocess raw patient appointment data using SQL.
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Tableau.
• Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models incorporating bias mitigation techniques.
•	Use SHAP explainability to interpret model decisions.
•	Version control with Git and share insights via a Tableau dashboard.
Tools & Technologies
Languages: SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn)
Database: SQLite
Visualisation: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP
Version Control: Git & GitHub
Necessary Python Libraries
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	shap
•	scikit-learn
•	xgboost
•	imbalanced-learn
Future Enhancements
•	Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time prediction.
•	Integrate external datasets (e.g., weather, transport availability).
•	Fine-tune with more advanced algorithms and ensembles.
•	Evaluate fairness metrics across demographic subgroups.
