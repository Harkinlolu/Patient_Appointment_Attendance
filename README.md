# 📊👨🏾‍💻 A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO REDUCING MISSED APPOINTMENTS AND IMPROVING HEALTHCARE EFFICIENCY

## 📝 Overview
This project aims to tackle the critical issue of missed medical appointments (no-shows) in healthcare systems. By applying a robust end-to-end data science pipeline, the objective is to predict patient attendance based on historical appointment data. This prediction enables better resource allocation, improved patient engagement, and optimised clinical workflows.

## 📑 Dataset 
Name - Medical Appointment No Shows
Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments/data

## 🎯 Objectives
Key objectives include:
•	Clean and preprocess raw patient appointment data using SQL.
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Tableau.
• Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models incorporating bias mitigation techniques.
•	Use SHAP explainability to interpret model decisions.
•	Version control with Git and share insights via a Tableau dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Languages: SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn)
Database: SQLite
Visualisation: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP
Version Control: Git & GitHub

## 📂 Necessary Python Libraries
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	shap
•	scikit-learn
•	xgboost
•	imbalanced-learn

## 🔜 Future Enhancements
•	Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time prediction.
•	Integrate external datasets (e.g., weather, transport availability).
•	Fine-tune with more advanced algorithms and ensembles.
•	Evaluate fairness metrics across demographic subgroups.
