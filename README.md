# 📊👨🏾‍💻 A Machine Learning Approach to Reducing Missed Appointments and Improving Healthcare Efficiency

## 📝 Overview
This project addresses the critical issue of missed medical appointments ("no-shows") in healthcare systems. By applying a robust, end-to-end data science pipeline, the goal is to **predict patient attendance** based on historical appointment data. Accurate predictions enable better **resource allocation**, **improved patient engagement**, and **optimised clinical workflows**.

## 📑 Dataset 
- **Name**: Medical Appointment No Shows  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments/data)

## 🎯 Objectives
Key objectives include:
- 🧼 Clean and preprocess raw appointment data using **SQL**
- 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Python** and **Tableau**
- 🤖 Build and evaluate multiple **machine learning models** with **bias mitigation techniques**
- 🧠 Apply **SHAP** explainability to interpret model predictions
- 🧾 Maintain version control with **Git** and communicate insights via a **Tableau dashboard**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: SQL, Python (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `imbalanced-learn`)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Visualisation**: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 📦 Required Python Libraries
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `shap`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `xgboost`  
- `imbalanced-learn`

## 🔜 Future Enhancements
- 🚀 Deploy model using **Flask** or **Streamlit** for real-time prediction
- 🌦️ Integrate external features (e.g., weather, transport availability)
- 🧪 Fine-tune models using **advanced algorithms and ensemble techniques**
- ⚖️ Evaluate **fairness metrics** across demographic subgroups
